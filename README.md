unchart-macros-for-e-MDs
========================

Preamble: I've written macros for e-MDs for about 5 years (2008-2013). I'm moving to a different EMR, unfortunately. Keith Toms will be in charge over time but I'll still be a consultant.

These macros were also know as *I'm Done* after the most useful macro that closes/saves/sends/etc depending on what it would take to be done with a spot in e-MDs. 

This includes typo correction (hooray!) and medical abbreviations. Abbreviations take time to learn (or create). But they can save about 2 hours a  month of typing. At 5-15 seconds at a time. Definitely reduces friction.

### Downloads and accounts

1. Create an account (free) on [Github.com](http://github.com)
1. Download the [Windows Github software](http://windows.github.com/) 
1. You'll need to download the [latest autohotkey](http://l.autohotkey.net/)
2.  Get the [SciTe editor for autohotkey](http://fincs.ahk4.net/scite4ahk/) so you get syntax highlighting.
3.  Last, [set up a free account on autohotkey's community forum](http://www.autohotkey.com/board/) The forum is very helpful if you're having trouble making things work. 

### Understanding Git and Github

Git is distributed version control. *Distributed* means that you and I  both have complete control over the code. I'm not the 'authority' and you can do whatever you want on your end. (But we can merge things when we're ready.) *Version Control* means that changes are carefully tracked over time. Tracking makes it much easier to try things. If it doesn't work, you can roll back to a previous state. By highlighting the differences (the 'diffs') between versions. it's much easier to follow how the code is being improved.

Git isn't a detail. It's worth learning about.

Bare Minimum: Read the [Git Parable](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html)

If you like videos, about [20-30 minutes from Github](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oRjP8yj2Wo&feature=share&list=PLg7s6cbtAD165JTRsXh8ofwRw0PqUnkVH) will get you up to speed
